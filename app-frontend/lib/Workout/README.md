# MQTT Schema
All the sensor data from the bikes are published to the MQTT topics, the app subscribes to these topics during the workouts to be able to display the information in real time to the user.  

Currently, the app subscribes to the `bike/{bikeID}/#` topic. The wildcard `#` will allow the app to automatically subscribe to all sub-topics which share the `bike/{bikeID}/` prefix.  

| Topic                    | Functionality                                                                                                                  |

| bike/{bikeID}/workout    | Facilitates starting and ending the workouts                                                                                   |
| bike/{bikeID}/speed      | Gets the current speed in KM/H from the sensor on the bike                                                                     |
| bike/{bikeID}/cadence    | Gets the current cadence in RPM from the sensor on the bike                                                                    |
| bike/{bikeID}/power      | Gets the current power generated in Watts from the sensor on the bike                                                          |
| bike/{bikeID}/heartrate  | Gets the current heart rate of the user in BPM                                                                                 |
| bike/{bikeID}/level      | Gets the current workout difficulty. In the ramped workout this is read only where we can set this value in the other workouts |
| bike/{bikeID}/fan        | Get the current wind speed generated by the fan in KM/H                                                                        |
| bike/{bikeID}/resistance | Not currently used by the app, gets the current resistance in as a percentage of max resistance                                |
| bike/{bikeID}/incline    | Not currently used by the app, gets the current incline as a value in degrees                                                  |
